## Project Description

As a developer, I found myself repeatedly executing the same tedious set of terminal commands to start my various projects, especially when switching between Laravel, Angular, and FastAPI environments. This routine quickly became both repetitive and inefficient. I realized that instead of repeating these commands daily, I could automate the process.

So, I created this Bash script to simplify and accelerate the process of launching my development projects. This script provides a user-friendly interface where I can select the project type and specify a port, with default values provided for convenience.

Additionally, I adapted the script to handle common issues I frequently encountered, such as port conflictsâ€”particularly with XAMPP and Apache. The script includes logic to automatically detect and resolve port usage issues, stop interfering services, and start the necessary development services cleanly.

This tool not only saves time but also minimizes frustration, allowing me to focus more on coding and less on setup hassles.
